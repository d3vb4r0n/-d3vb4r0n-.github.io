A little article about me

Hello, my name is Maxim Pivitsyn and I am a student at a technological university. I don't have a lot of experience working with Git, as I have only done a few projects, but I am here to learn and improve my skills. I am involved in the digital department at my university and will likely need to use GitHub frequently for my work. In addition to my studies, I have other interests that I plan to pursue after graduation. These include economics, Java (you can't tell this from my Github account), travel, and reading books and articles related to these topics.
